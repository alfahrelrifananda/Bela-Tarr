            <h1>Béla Tarr</h1>
            <p>
              Béla Tarr (b. 1955) is the ultimate auteurist's auteur, an artist
              who ascended from a cult director little known outside of his
              native Hungary to one of the most revered figures in world cinema
              today, all the while stoking an enflamed cinephilia among his
              growing legion of passionate followers.

                <p class="paragraph">
                  Béla Tarr (born July 21, 1955) is an acclaimed Hungarian film
                  director. Much of his work is marked by philosophical elements
                  and a pessimistic view of humanity. His films utilize
                  unconventional storytelling methods, such as long takes and/or
                  non-professional actors to achieve realism.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                  Debuting with his film Family Nest in 1979, Tarr underwent a
                  period of what he refers to as "social cinema", aimed at
                  telling mundane stories about ordinary people, often in the
                  style of cinema vérité. Over the next decade, the
                  cinematography of Tarr's films gradually changed; Damnation
                  (1988) was shot with languid camera movement aimed at
                  establishing ambience. It marked Tarr's earliest
                  experimentation with philosophical themes, focused mostly on
                  bleak and desolate representations of reality. Sátántangó
                  (1994) and Werckmeister Harmonies (2000) continued this
                  approach; both are considered by some critics to be among the
                  greatest films ever made. Tarr would later compete in the 2007
                  Cannes Film Festival with his film The Man From London.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                  Frequent collaborators of Tarr include his wife Ágnes
                  Hranitzky, novelist László Krasznahorkai, film composer Mihály
                  Víg, cinematographer Fred Kelemen, and actress Erika Bók.
                  After the release of his film The Turin Horse (2011), Tarr
                  announced his definitive retirement from film direction. He
                  has been teaching at the Sarajevo Film School since.

                conceive the scenes, how we can turn around somebody, you know,

                think about the story. The film isn't the story. It's mostly
                picture, sound, a lot of emotions. The stories are just covering
